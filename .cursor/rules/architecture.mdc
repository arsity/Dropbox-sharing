# Dropbox-like File Sharing Simulator Architecture

This project implements a file sharing simulator using a client-server model.

For simplicity, we only consider one user and no GUI, authentication, and security design.

## Core Components

*   **Server (`[server.py](mdc:server.py)`)**: Manages the central file system state and handles client requests. The main entry point for starting the server is `[main_server.py](mdc:main_server.py)`.
*   **Client (`[client.py](mdc:client.py)`)**: Manages a local replica of the shared folder, monitors local changes, and synchronizes with the server. The main entry point for starting a client is `[main_client.py](mdc:main_client.py)`.
*   **Protocol (`[protocol.py](mdc:protocol.py)`)**: Defines the communication rules and message formats between the server and clients.
